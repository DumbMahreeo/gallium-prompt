# RGB colors



Functions such as `text_rgb` and `background_rgb` accept RGB colors.

This means that the first, second and third arguments must be numbers between `0` and `255`



`text_rgb` also accepts a fourth optional argument which can be either:

* `bold` or `true`, which will make your text look bold (or bright);

* `normal` or `false`, which will do absolutely nothing.



## Note

Your terminal must support truetype colors in order for any of these functions to work.
